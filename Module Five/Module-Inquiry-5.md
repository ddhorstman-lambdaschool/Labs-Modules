# Module Inquiry 5

## Questions

1. Pick one team member. What is a piece of feedback you have yet to give them?
> I wish I had a good example, but we usually discuss feedback pretty openly and immediately.
2. What's an example of some recent feedback you received that was easy to hear? What about recent feedback that was difficult to hear? What do you think made them easy or difficult to process?
> We haven't exchanged formal feedback, and unfortunately I can't think of a moment where I got informal feedback that was difficult to hear.
3. What's the most memorable feedback you've ever received? What was it about the feedback that made such an impact?
> I took a writing course in college where the teacher pointed out that my sentences were often too long, and that my writing would be improved by varying sentence structure to create interest. It was the first time I really got quality critical feedback on my writing from a teacher. It lead me to a total rethinking of my writing style, the first time I'd done so in years. Now I try to balance my desire to write long sentences with the need for clarity.
4. What do you think the difference is between constructive and non-constructive feedback?
> Constructive feedback points toward a course of action for improvement - non-constructive feedback tends to be focused only on what's wrong.
