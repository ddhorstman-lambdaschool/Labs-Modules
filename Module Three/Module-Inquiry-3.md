# Module Inquiry 3

## Questions

1. What feature did you work on with a teammate up to this point in the sprint?
> We worked on building a Redux store to keep track of the cities a user has selected and their detailed data.
2. When were you the driver? When were you the navigator? Which role did you prefer and why?
> We didn't really follow a strict driver/navigator structure; my partner's internet was too slow to screenshare, so I was the "driver" the whole time, but we spent a good chunk of our time discussing each decision rather than having a dedicated "navigator" to lead the decision-making.
3. What was difficult about being a navigator?
> The hardest part was communicating clearly. I imagine a large part of the benefit of pair programming is that you have to explain your ideas to someone else, and in so doing, you develop a better understanding.
4. How will you adjust your pair programming behavior in the future?
> Ideally I'd love to be in a spot where it is possible to have someone else "drive". A trick I picked up was to explain ideas with pseudocode instead of purely verbally; I'd definitely do more of that in a future pair programming situation.
