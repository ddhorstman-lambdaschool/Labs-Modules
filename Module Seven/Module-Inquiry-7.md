# Module Inquiry 7

## Questions

1. What piece of feedback have you appreciated the most?
> It was pointed out that I still come across as respectful even when I'm expressing a dissenting opinion. I work really hard on that, and I was glad to hear that my effort pays off sometimes.
1. What piece of feedback do you feel resistant to?
    - Why do you think you're resisting it?
    - What do you consider valid about it and what strikes you as inaccurate?
> There's nothing here that strikes me as inaccurate. I'm resistant to the feedback that I have a tendency to take over and don't explain my thought process sufficiently, because it's totally true and I am unhappy about that. The irony is I used to be a teacher, and I did an at least somewhat better job at explaining things back then. The next time someone runs into a bug or has a question, I'll try to pull out some "teacher mode" and focus on talking them through my suggestions rather than implementing it too eagerly.
3. What's an example of feedback that doesn't surprise you?
> I'm not at all surprised that people pointed out I am assertive and opinionated. At this point, I've accepted that that's who I am, and I do my best to work around the downsides of those personality traits.
4. What's an example of feedback that surprised you?
> People commented that I was a good communicator! I feel like I have a lot of difficulty expressing my ideas and understanding others' ideas, but it's possible I'm more successful at doing so than I give myself credit for.
