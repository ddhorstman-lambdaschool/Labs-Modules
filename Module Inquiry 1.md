# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?
> We asked for further clarification in terms of the type(s) of data to display. We asked about which cities to include - we're starting with US cities with a population above 50,000.
2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
> - As a user, I can search for a city by name
> - As a user, I can view historical population data for a city
> - As a user, I can view historical weather data for a city
> - As a user, I can view major job industries in a city
> - As a user, I can view historical housing prices in a city
> - As a user, I can compare multiple cities side-by-side
3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
> For city comparison:
> - Add a checkbox to each city to select it for comparison
> - Keep track of which cities are selected (up to 3)
> - Prevent the user from selecting more than 3 cities
> - Add a button to open comparison view if at least two cities are selected
> - Create a comparison view that shows all data side-by-side
- What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
> - We did a good job in determining individual tasks and breaking them down.
> - We left most of our engineering tasks vague, and could benefit from more detailed planning.
4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
> - I think I would have divided the tasks between Web and DS sooner, so that we could discuss implementation details among ourselves earlier to create a more detailed roadmap.
